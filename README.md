# Double Hiding of HTML Element
This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to hiding an element using both `display: none` and `visibility: hidden` in JavaScript. The bug is subtle and can lead to unexpected behavior. The `bug.html` file contains the incorrect code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the correct solution.  The solution shows that it's unnecessary and potentially harmful to use both methods simultaneously.
